# Voyager
Voyager is a fully async API wrapper for the [NASA Open APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/)
written in Python.

I am only the creator of this wrapper library. The APIs are owned and maintained
by their respective maintainers.

If you have any questions or need support, please join the [Voyager Discord 
Support Server](https://discord.gg/D4b9A6Wjwe). *As of right now, the invite

"voyager" there.*
